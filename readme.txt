== Description ==
The Authentication by LoginRadius WordPress plugin allow you to replace the default WordPress Authentication feature with diverse authentication methods, including standard login (email login) and social login. This plugin also provides the forgot password and reset password features.

The other benefits you get from using this plugin are enhanced security via multi-factor authentication, and effective user management features. Let’s have a more in-depth look into the plugin features:

= Authentication Methods: = You get to choose a user authentication method based on your target audience and use cases. 


- Standard login (email login):  You can customize the registration fields based on your business nature, where email id and password remain the default fields.  Once registered, the consumers can log in to their account using the email id and password.
- Social login:  You can choose the desired social providers from 20+ social providers like Facebook, Google, Twitter, as a quick and convenient registration and login approach for consumers. It is easy to configure the social login options using this plugin.

Note: Our <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/loginradius-customer-identity-and-access-management/" target="_blank">Authentication and SSO Plugin</a> supports the additional authentication methods like Phone Login, Passwordless Login and Single Sign-On (SSO). 

= Effective User Management: = The consumers data remains available in the WordPress Admin Panel and the LoginRadius Admin Console. And you can efficiently perform all user management actions in the LoginRadius Admin Console, permitting the necessary support to your consumers in managing their accounts.


= In addition to the above, the plugin offers the following additional features: =


- Easy to integrate via API secret and API key (available in your LoginRadius Account).
- Reduces user abandonment rates.
- LoginRadius manages consumer provisioning, de-provisioning, authentication, and authorization. Hence no extra efforts are needed to handle registration, login, reset passwords flows.
- Existing data migration to LoginRadius Admin Console and those migrated users can authenticate themself on your WordPress application.
- Data is encrypted end to end at transmission as well as at rest.
